    "#  Q1.A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It provides a way to manage, store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. Databases are widely used in various applications, ranging from small-scale personal projects to large-scale enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here's a brief differentiation between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Structure:\n",
    "#    - SQL databases are based on a structured data model known as the relational model. They store data in tables with predefined schemas, where each table consists of rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established through keys (primary and foreign keys).\n",
    "#     - NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not follow a rigid schema. They are designed to store and retrieve unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are schema-less or have flexible schemas that allow for dynamic changes in data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Scalability:\n",
    "#    - SQL databases typically scale vertically, which means they handle increased workload by upgrading hardware resources (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) on a single server. They are well-suited for applications with complex relationships and structured data.\n",
    "#    - NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing them to handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to a distributed system. They excel in handling massive volumes of unstructured or rapidly changing data, making them suitable for highly scalable and distributed applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Query Language:\n",
    "#    - SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for defining and manipulating the data. SQL provides a powerful and expressive syntax for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in a relational database.\n",
    "#    - NoSQL databases employ various query languages specific to their data model. For example, MongoDB uses a flexible query language based on JavaScript-like syntax, while Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language) similar to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. ACID Transactions:\n",
    "#    - SQL databases generally support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability. ACID transactions guarantee that a set of database operations either succeed or fail as a single unit, maintaining data consistency.\n",
    "#    - NoSQL databases often relax ACID properties to achieve higher scalability and performance. They prioritize availability and partition tolerance (known as the CAP theorem), sacrificing some level of consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Use Cases:\n",
    "#    - SQL databases are commonly used in applications that require complex querying, strong data consistency, and structured relationships, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and traditional enterprise applications.\n",
    "#    - NoSQL databases are well-suited for use cases involving large-scale data ingestion, real-time analytics, content management systems, social media platforms, and applications with constantly changing data structures or high scalability requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's important to note that the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application, including the data structure, scalability needs, and desired consistency guarantees. In some cases, a combination of both types, known as polyglot persistence, may be used to leverage the strengths of each database system for different parts of an application #/"

    "# Maintains Referential Integrity: The values in the foreign key column must match the values in the primary key column of the referenced table, or be null (if allowed).\n",
    "# Supports Relationships: Foreign keys establish relationships between tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships."
